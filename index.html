        <p>Dummy text refers to the 
            bits of content that are used to fill a website mock-up. This text helps web designers
             better envision how the website will look as a finished product. It is important to understand that 
             dummy text has no meaning whatsoever. Its sole purpose is to fill out blank spaces with “word-like” content, 
             without making any copyright infringements.</p>

 <p>Now you know what dummy text is, let’s learn about its usefulness.
       Some people say that they don’t need to use a dummy text generator
        to deliver a web design project to the customer.
        Even though this might be true, the effect that the final project will produce on the client won’t be as 
        satisfactory as in the case of one with included filler content
      A dummy text generator gives web designers the content they need. Then, they can use the typefaces and layout they prefer,
       thus obtaining the best mock-up of their work. It would be best to be impossible to understand and read because people might get distracted by the text itself
        and its nonsense rather than analyzing how the typefaces integrate into the design instead.
      Dummy text shouldn’t make any logical sense, to keep people from focusing on it instead of the visual impact it has.
     Using filler text is all about facilitating the visual impression of a final piece of web design.
